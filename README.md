# Wallet Service

A backend financial service for wallet management and peer-to-peer money transfers.
Built as a backend engineering project to practice authentication, SQL transactions,
caching, and async messaging - not a real payment product, just for learning/demo purposes.

## Features

- JWT based authentication (access + refresh tokens)
- Wallet balance, deposit, withdraw
- P2P money transfer with:
  - row-level locking to handle concurrent transfers safely
  - idempotency key support so retried requests don't double-charge
  - double entry ledger (every transfer creates a DEBIT + CREDIT entry)
- Redis caching for balance reads + rate limiting on auth/transfer routes
- Kafka event published on every completed transaction, consumed by a
  notification "service" that just logs to console (no real email sending)
- Swagger docs for all endpoints
- Jest + Supertest tests

## Tech stack and why

| Tech | Why it's here |
|---|---|
| Express | simple, well known REST framework, no need for anything heavier for this scope |
| PostgreSQL | need real ACID transactions, a transfer touches 2 wallets + 2 ledger rows and all of it needs to succeed or fail together |
| JWT | stateless auth, no session store needed |
| bcrypt | slow hashing so passwords can't be brute forced easily |
| Redis | (1) cache wallet balance so we're not hitting postgres on every read (2) rate limiting auth/transfer endpoints |
| Kafka | decouples sending a notification from the actual money transfer - if notification consumer is down, transfers still work |
| Swagger | auto generated docs from code comments |
| Jest/Supertest | unit + integration testing |
| Docker Compose | spins up postgres/redis/kafka locally without installing them manually |

## Getting started

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in values (defaults work with docker-compose).

2. Start the infra (postgres, redis, kafka, zookeeper):

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

3. Install deps:

```bash
npm install
```

4. Run the schema + seed data against postgres:

```bash
psql -h localhost -U wallet_user -d wallet_service -f sql/schema.sql
psql -h localhost -U wallet_user -d wallet_service -f sql/seed.sql
```

5. Start the app:

```bash
npm run dev
```

6. Docs are at `http://localhost:3000/api-docs`

## Testing

```bash
npm test
```

Note: tests hit an actual postgres instance so make sure docker-compose is up
and the schema has been applied first.

## Database design

Instead of just storing a `balance` column and blindly updating it, every
transfer/deposit/withdraw writes to a `ledger_entries` table too (DEBIT/CREDIT).
This means the balance can always be double-checked by summing the ledger,
which is closer to how real financial systems work. There's an admin endpoint
(`/admin/reconcile/:walletId`) that checks this for a given wallet.

## Concurrency handling

If two transfer requests hit the same wallet at the same time, we don't want
a lost update (e.g. two withdrawals both reading balance=100 and both
succeeding when only one should). The transfer logic locks both wallet rows
with `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE` inside a DB transaction, and always locks in a
consistent order (sorted by wallet id) so two transfers going in opposite
directions between the same two wallets can't deadlock each other.

### Testing it for real

Didn't want to just trust this by reading the code, so there's a script
(`scripts/concurrency-test.js`) that actually fires a bunch of transfer
requests at the same wallet at once and checks the math after.

Ran it with 30 concurrent requests, 10 each, starting balance 1000:
30 requests fired
20 succeeded, 10 failed (rate limiter kicked in - "too many transfer requests, slow down")
expected sender balance: 800
actual sender balance:   800
PASS - no lost updates

The 10 failures are the rate limiter doing its job (max 20 transfer requests/min
per IP), not a bug. The important part is the 20 that got through all hit the
locking logic at basically the same time and the balance still came out exact.
If the `FOR UPDATE` lock wasn't there, this is where you'd expect to see the
balance come out higher than 800 (some debit getting silently overwritten by
another request that read stale data).

Run it yourself with:
```bash
npm run test:concurrency
```
(server needs to be running already, in a separate terminal)

## Idempotency

Transfer requests can include an `Idempotency-Key` header. If the same key is
sent twice, the second request just returns the original transaction instead
of transferring the money again. This matters for real world clients that
retry on network timeouts.

## Notes / things not in scope

- No UI yet, this is API only for now (basic UI planned later, separate from this repo's tech stack)
- No session/token blacklist table, logout is just handled client side
- Kafka is used for a single event type only, kept intentionally simple
